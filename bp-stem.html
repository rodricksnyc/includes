												<p>Federal statute prohibits EEOC from making public employment data derived from any of its compliance data collections (i.e. Section 709(e) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended).</p>
												<p class="card-ques"><b>Can the public request employment data for federal contractors?</b></p>
												<p>In select cases, the public may obtain employment data for federal [government] contractors companies that hold the prime contract, or companies that are a first-tier subcontractors to the prime.

												<p class="card-ques"><b>How does the EEOC respond to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for an employer’s EEO-1 report?</b></p>
												<p>The EEOC assesses FOIA requests at the time they are received. FOIA Exemptions 3 and 4 may protect an employer’s EEO-1 reports from disclosure. FOIA Exemption 3 covers information that is prohibited from disclosure by another federal law. Section 709(e) of Title VII, in turn, forbids “any [EEOC] officer or employee” from making “public in any manner whatever any information obtained by the Commission . . . prior to the institution of any [Title VII] proceeding . . . involving such information.” FOIA Exemption 4 protects privileged and confidential trade secrets and commercial or financial information. Pursuant to the Supreme Court’s recent decision, Food Marketing Institute v. Argus Leader Media, --- S. Ct. ---, 2019 WL 2570624 (June 24, 2019), Exemption 4 protects information that is customarily and actually treated as private by its owner and provided to the government under an assurance of privacy.</p>

													<p>Employers are required to offer employees an opportunity to self-identify for the purposes of the EEO-1 report. This information can be collected on applications or a voluntary survey. The employer would collect the data voluntarily and aggregate this information into the EEO-1 report. When collecting information, employers should notify employees that providing this information is voluntary.</p>
													<p class="card-ques"><b>Can an employer write in an employee's ethnicity if they think they know?</b></p>
													<p>Self-identification by the employee is the preferred method of identifying the race and ethnic information necessary for the EEO-1 report. Employers are required to offer employees the opportunity to use self-identification to complete the EEO-1 report. If an employee declines to self-identify, employment records or observation may be used.</p>
													<p class="card-ques"><b>Does the EEO-1 report collect employee non-binary gender data?</b></p>
													<p>No. The EEO-1 report continues to only collect either male or female binary employee gender data.  A filer may report employee data for non-binary gender employees on the Remarks page in the online filing system.  Please preface the remark with the phrase “Additional Employee Data”.</p>
													<p class="card-ques"><b>How do employers classify employees into the job categories listed in the EEO-1 report?</b></p>
													<p>The job categories are based on employee skill level, knowledge and responsibilities and are designed to reflect common company hierarchies. Please select the category that best reflects employees in the company.</p>
													<p>To help, there is a job classification guide that maps Standard Occupational Classifications (SOC) and Census Job Codes to the job classifications, which can be accessed <a class="blueColor" href="">here</a>.</p>

													<p class="card-ques"><b>What is the difference between a single-establishment and a multi-establishment company?</b></p>
													<p>A single-establishment company does business at only one physical address. A multi-establishment company does business at two or more physical addresses.</p>
													<p>Single-establishment companies are only required to submit one EEO-1 data record/report. Multi-establishment companies are required to submit a) separate report for the headquarters, b) separate report for each establishment of the company with 50 or more employees, c) separate report for each establishment with fewer than 50 employees, and d) consolidated report that includes all employees.</p>
													<p class="card-ques"><b>How do employers report employees who work at client sites?</b></p>
													<p>Employers have the option to either a) report employees working at client sites using the client site address as the location of the establishment, or b) roll those up to a non-client site employer address.</p>

													<p class="card-ques"><b>What are the options for submitting the EEO-1 Report?</b></p>
													The preferred and most efficient method of submitting Component 1 EEO-1 reports is through the EEO-1 Online Filing System or as an electronically transmitted datafile (ASCII/TEXT or CSV/XML file) via a data file upload.  The filer support page on the website will include data file upload instructions in April 2021, when data collection launches. Specifications will be similar to previous years. For a summary of the data employers will need to collect, please see the factsheets on Preparing Data – Single-establishment <a class="blueColor" href="">here</a>, or Preparing Data – Multi-establishment <a class="blueColor" href="">here</a>.</p>
													<p class="card-ques"><b>Is a company able to file for previous years if it was required but failed to do so before the deadline?</b></p>
													<p>No. There is no way to file for previous years once the data collection has closed. The EEO-1 online filing system does not allow employers to file for previous years. In 2021, filers will file for 2019 and 2020 because the 2019 filing period was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

If necessary, contact the EEO-1 Filer Support team to obtain the company passcode, and update the contact information if need.

											<p>A PEO is not required to report employees for a client company that would not be required to if they were not in the PEO relationship. For example, a single establishment company and non-federal contractor with 40 employees would not report under the existing rule. Therefore, these co-employees would not be reported by a PEO.</p>

											<p class="card-ques"><b>Which NAICS code(s) should a PEO use for its headquarters and any establishment reports?</b></p>
											<p>PEOs should use NAICS Code 561330 – Professional Employer Organizations, to file for their headquarters and any establishment locations in which the major business activity is in providing human resources and human resource management services to client businesses. All client company establishments should be assigned NAICS based on major business activity at the establishment.</p>
											<p class="card-ques"><b>If an organization’s EEO-1 reporting is handled by a PEO, can the EEOC Employer Data Team provide the organization with its establishment EEO-1 reports or any client company data directly?</b></p>

											<p class="card-ques"><b>Can a PEO submit 2019 and 2020 EEO-1 reports for one client company before filing 2019 and 2020 EEO-1 reports for another client company?</b></p>
